Repository for the code used in the data analysis of the paper "Antarctic plastisphere contains unique and abundant antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements"

I have made no attempts to get the code to work outside of my machine, so I cannot ensure it will do so from the get go. In any case, if you have any issues with it I'll try to look into it.

Also, some files were written years ago, at the very beggining of my coding career. I make no excuses for their quality.
