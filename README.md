Repository for the code used in the data analysis of the paper "Antarctic plastisphere contains unique and abundant antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements". The raw data generated by the SmartChip analysis is also included (the .csv files found within the "resistome" directory)

If you find any trouble running the code, you can write me at juan.valenzuela@uam.es and I'll try to solve your questions to the best of my ability.

Also, if you found the code useful, please cite the paper! It helps me so much.
